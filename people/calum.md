# Calum

Calum, just Calum, was found in the midst of the worst storm in recent memory, quite by accident. Aiden, his now adoptive grandfather was travelling along the coast and quite by chance and possibly the will of the gods he heard two year old Calum screeching from the wreckage of the ship “Stormrider.” 
Aiden brought the toddler back to his family’s manor and gave him to his daughter Bridget who then raised Calum as her own along with her two biological daughters, Erin (6) and Kelly (4). 
While the clan was dark haired and hazel eyes Calum stood out at gatherings. His thick blonde hair and piercing blue eyes stood out among the family. His mother told him that when the ship wrecked he became one with the storm, lightning caused his hair to lighten and the rain pooled in his eyes, causing them to change color and that’s how he survived long enough for grandpa to find him. 
As Calum got older he began to wonder more and more of his origins. One day it became too much for his mother “I don’t know Calum, I really can’t explain how or why you’re here. Or how in god’s name you survived that storm! But all I know is that I am so happy you did. And we love you so much.” 
This sated him for a bit, but as he travelled beyond the manor and encountered more and more Briwithians his appearance fast caused more questions. Although no one ever made fun of him or betrayed him for it, it caused him a certain amount of discomfort, thankfully Riordan was always there, had his back through everything growing up, except when it came to fighting, Calum finished most of those. 
In his early teens he learned a great deal of combat techniques from his grandfather. It seemed to come almost too naturally to the young boy that his father, Alan began to worry about him a bit. 
Bridget and Aiden, however, found it incredible. He was the only grandchild to completely master Aidens “axe toss” which is exactly what it sounds like, except with a 2 handed battle axe or great axe. 
When Calum turned 15 he bid his family farewell and left the manor, looking for adventure. 

Soon after he enlisted in a mercenary group, The Fanged Goliath. Already having a background and some martial prowess Calum soon became a ground soldier in the ranks of this small army. They were mostly charged with uprooting bandit and goblin hideaways each battle Calum became stronger. He also learned a few simple magical cantrips from the Group’s mage. Who was impressed and surprised by the lads magical affinity. Rather then pursue this, Calum focused on martial combat, particularly the axe, great, battle, and hand axes, with a minor degree in short sword and shield. 
After 2 years of putting down small pockets of outlaws, the Fanged Goliath was hired by a shady Briwithian noble to help him put down a rebellion in his territory. 
The militia itself proved to be little trouble, Calum slew many of his own countrymen that day. After a three month campaign, the FG had dealt with all but one are of rebels. They came upon the town and Calum soon realized that there weren’t any rebels near this village, because he was on the recon team who scouted the town prior to the battle, before he could give his report, a fellow soldier named Angus blurted out to commander Vex how there were hundreds of soldiers in the garrison and we should attack swiftly. Calum was absolutely dumbfounded head swirling, wishing his cousin was here to explain what was happening he felt so helpless as the FG moved in on the city, “No, no this..no this is wrong.” Calum kept whispering as he marched with his comrades into the unprotected settlement. 
Carnage ensued.
 (Ok imagine Jon snow in Kong’s Lansing. But hang on ima do something about it.) 
“No, no no this is wrong. No.” Calum whispered as he walked through the city, 

Clouds started forming 

“No..this is wrong.”

Rain started falling, thunder began rumbling as he felt his rage began to boil within him. 
Then time stopped completely and Calum saw (Odin) “The time is now, son. What will you do?” 
Calum regained consciousness amid the “battle” he saw two soldiers bearing down on a family. A monstrous thunderclap boomed across the heavens as the soldiers were instantly incinerated by a blast of lightning from Calum. 
Calum looked at his hands then at his axe, which had been replaced by an unfamiliar one, then at the terrified family. 
The power of the storm raged through him as he took to the skies, blasting the FG with bolts of electricity from his axe and hands. 
He then saw Vex terrified and making a bee line for the trees, winding up he tossed his axe with all his might, lodging it in Vex’s skull, killing him instantly. After cleaning up the rest of the FG, the village hailed him as a god and then….


Everything went dark and time stopped, he awoke on the shores of Norway. An old man missing an eye smiled at him, “I knew, no, I know you have it in you son, this does not make up for your past transgressions against me and your mother, but it is certainly a start, Bridget and Alan seem to have taught you better then I even could have. Now, awake.” 

Calum woke up in a bed, Riordan smiling at him, “How are ya cousin! Long time no see, I have a business proposal for ya!”
