# Valierre "Val" Pontfotaine VIII

 Val is an excitable and somewhat pompous human who is actually an android, created only a few years ago and instilled with a lifetime's worth of memories. He has an incredibly powerful processor and a massive hard drive, granting him exceptional intelligence. However, he was manufactured with very little physical strength, so despite his decent agility and extraordinary resilience, he is unable to do much heavy lifting. He is in charge of maps and navigation, which is perfect for him since he is obsessed with gathering new information whenever possible, and is constantly soaking up new data on the geography, topography, weather patterns, population, and all other conceivable topics of all the places they visit. He keeps extremely accurate records and draws extremely accurate maps, making him perfect for his job. He can be socially awkward due to his barebones socialization programming, but overall he is mostly loveable and endearing, despite his distracted aloofness.
