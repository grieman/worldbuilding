# Trammitch "Whiplash" Jones

 The quartermaster of the Ace of Harts is Trammitch Jones, but everyone aboard knows him simply as "Whiplash" or, if they're feeling particularly chummy with him, "Whip". He is a stern and unrelenting taskmaster, who demands the very best from everyone under him. Despite this, he has a heart of gold and is well loved and respected by the crew. He is a leader in every sense, accepting no excuses and delivering punishment when necessary, but always at the forefront and leading by example when hard work is required. Though he holds his crew to an extremely high standard of excellence, he will be the first to accept full responsibility for any failure that occurs under his command. He is a strong and virtuous leader, and carries himself with a gravitas that demands true respect.
