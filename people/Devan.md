# Devan Caravast

Devan is Lean and dark-haired, in his early twenties. It seems like he's always on deck or up in the rigging and he's a heck of a climber. He also got a broad assortment of knives, and uses them to great effect. He's quite professional, though he has a somewhat morbid sense of humor.
