# School of Lore 


## LEVEL 2 

**Lore Savant**: Starting at 2nd level, you become a compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics. Choose two skills from Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses those skills.
In addition, your analytical abilities are so well-honed that your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice).

**Malleable Casting**: At 2nd level, you master the component pieces of magic to the point where you can modify spells as they are cast.
When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, psychic, radiant, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with another from the list.

Once you have used this ability three times, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again. This limit increases to four at 6th level, 5 at 10th level, and 6 at 12th level.

Note that, given your focus on the elemental process behind a variety of spell types, you have no advantage while copying spells of any school into your spellbook


## LEVEL 6 

**Structural Shift**: When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from one ability score to another of your choice. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Note: If the modified spell applies a status effect to a target that would have a detrimental effect on the target’s ability to save from that spell, that detrimental effect is ignored when the target attempts its subsequent saves. 

(e.g. Hold person with a DEX save - if the target fails the first save and is paralyzed, it DOES NOT automatically fail its subsequent DEX saves and will instead attempt to save as if it were not paralyzed).

**Spell Augmentation**: At 6th level, you learn to augment your spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, applying your intimate knowledge of the arcane to maximize the elemental effectiveness of your work. An additional 1st level spell slot increases the damage by 2d12, and each additional level increases the damage by a further 1d12, to a maximum of 6d12 for a 5th level slot. This ability cannot be used on a spell that automatically hits, such as Magic Missile. The extra damage is of the same type as the spell being augmented.

[Note the there may be a future cap at INT mod number of creatures taking the additional damage]


## LEVEL 10

Prodigious Memory: At 10th level, you have attained a greater mastery of spell preparation. As a bonus action, you can replace one spell you have prepared with another spell from your spell-book. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.


## LEVEL 14

**Master of Magic**: At 14th level, your knowledge of magic allows you to duplicate almost any spell. As a bonus action, you can call to mind the ability to cast one spell of 8th level or lower of your choice from any class’s spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you mustn’t have it prepared, and you follow the normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot. If the spell isn’t a wizard spell, it counts as a wizard spell when you cast it. The ability to cast the spell vanishes from your mind when you cast it or when the current turn ends.
You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

You also gain an additional use of Structural Shift

If the modified spell applies a status effect to a target that would have a detrimental effect on the target’s ability to save from that spell, that detrimental effect is no longer ignored when the target attempts its subsequent saves.
