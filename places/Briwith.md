# Briwith

## Mythic Origins

> From the Amhaín came Order. Order was the world, and Order was the first of the Stewards. 

-- Opening of _An Chéad Leabhar_

Like the rest of the world, there Briwith has no history before the Third Ruin. It shares the common Myths of Ruin: the first was a war of the gods, the second a great storm, and the third the War of the Endbringers. There's a few small regional differences, most notably that the gods involved in the first ruin - and thus the gods worshiped by most of the surrounding world, as they were the victors of this war - were in fact minor gods, tasked with being _stewards_ of the order created by the one major god, referred to as the _Amhaín_. They share most myths of the second ruin with their neighbors, placing blame for the storm on a group of mages known as the _Stormbinders_. They share myths of the Endbringers, and even have some formations on their seaside cliffs that are said to have been where they came to life and pulled themselves out of the rock. The frequency of these formations caused the war to be deeply ingrained into the collective memory, to the point where their calendar, now in its two-thousand and nineteenth year, starts at the last sighting of an Endbringer.

## The Rule of Clans

From that first year, Briwith was organized into family clans. Naturally, the larger, more powerful, or more skilled clans rose to prominence until some other clan rose above them, and the ruling structure changed fluidly over time, with smaller, more vulnerable clans allying themselves with the powerful for protection. Interestingly, this never evolved into a true feudal system because the clans would organize amongst themselves to put down any clan that became 'too powerful or tyrannical'. That clan would then be dissolved, and the members left to either join other clans or start their own. 

Prominent clans in modern politics include:
* The Murphys, in the southwest of the island
* The McWards, around Baile Gealbán
* The MacCearans
* The Carneys
* The Finnegans
* The Scullys
* The Conaráins, the clan of the first and second Ardli, Oisín and Oadhan

## Unity and Rising Threats

The tenuous rule of clans began to be tested around the year 1990. The empire of Hesseandum had been settling small towns along the coast of the mainland and traded aggressively with Briwith - or rather, the western coast of Briwith and the clans which were strongest there. Naturally this upset the balance of the island, and those clans quickly grew more powerful than their rivals. Two clans benefitted the most - the Conaráins in the north and the MacCearans in the south. Within a few years, the Conaráins siezed the opportunity for military expansion. Led by Niadh, they forced their supremacy over all of the surrounding clans, before an alliance headed by the MacCearans destroyed the clan. The members all left the name and worked to join other clans, but Niadh's second son, Oisín, claimed the right to keep the clan's name and home after the deaths of his father and brother, and set to reforging the clan. He wed Fennore Labhradha and slowly turned his small holdings into a prosperous trading city, the first to build the great ships that could reach further than just Hesseandum's colonies.

For the next six years, the island was dominated by MacCearans, who gradually levied taxes and tributes from the other southern clans. As had happened many times before, the islands other clans allied, and in 1999 they rebelled, narrowly defeating Breacan MacCearan at the Battle of Great Greenfield. The rebelling clans - McWard, Gealban, Finnegan, Scully, and Carney - formed an alliance they dubbed the Free Clans, and again there was a balance of power on the island, though it was overshadowed by the spread of Hesseandum.

By 2006, Oisin had reformed his clan as the moral leader of the island, willing to aid any clans who asked and preaching the need for all to work together in order to survive Hesseandum's expansion. The northern tribes had taken to calling him _Ardli_ - which loosely translates to _he who warns_ - and he embraced it. When Laserian rebelled against the Free Clans and employed Hesseandic forces, he sent his own troops to guard many of the southern towns - some even claim that the militia forces that eventually dispersed the Fanged Goliath had been led by some of Oisin's commandos. Seeing the destruction that the Fanged Goliath had brought across the sea, the Free Clans agreed to listen to Oisin, who would have regular meetings of clans to ensure that grievances were addressed peacefully, and that the island as a whole prospered. And prosper it did. Under Oisin's loose leadership, the island grew rich and better able to defend itself, with Oisin's son Oadhan leading a united army to throw back the exiled Western Legion from Hesseandum.

The _Ardli_, though, soon grew ill, and passed in 2014. Leaders from all clans assembled for his funeral, and Eamon Scully dubbed Oadhan _Ardli_, which was accepted by all in attendance. Oadhan has since led the isle though rockier times, as Hesseandum starts to look beyond its frontier yet again.


> "I fear that it is only a matter of time until our division serves us to Hesseandum, to be put under its yoke like so many others. We can remain free with one common purpose - the preservation of that freedom that has served us all so well. Let us leave here knowing that our sons will work to support one another, and the independence of our people."

-- Oisín Conaráin, the Ardli, in his first address to the Free Clans
